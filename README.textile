h1. The Clock Divider

This is a patch for an Arduino UNO to divide an input audio rate (48kHz) clock to a movement rate (120Hz) clock. It is a relative straightforward patch that uses interrupts.

It does, however, not use the relatively slow @digitalWrite()@ but direct register manipulation  "as documented here":https://www.instructables.com/id/Fast-digitalRead-digitalWrite-for-Arduino/. This also means that it is not usable on different Arduino's.
